There is mounting evidence that routine biased technological change is a structural economic cause of radical right parties’ ascent. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how different forms of technological disruption influence support for the radical right, and there is a notable void in understanding the effects of artificial intelligence. This is a relevant research gap as AI impacts different social groups than previous automation technologies. While robotization has impacted mainly the middle-skilled working class, AI is replacing high-skilled professionals and technicians. This paper aims to bridge this gap by examining artificial intelligence automation’s effect on voting behaviour. I hypothesize that the advancements in this new technology have significantly contributed to the support for radical right parties. I analyse data from the eighth to tenth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), encompassing responses from 25 European countries. I capture exposure to AI using a novel measure based on the overlap between technological patent capabilities and occupational tasks. Preliminary findings yield robust evidence suggesting that AI disruption has played a relevant role in driving the growth of the radical right. I test the causality of this relationship through an Instrumental Variable (IV). I also test the potential causal mechanisms of this link. The results carry significant implications. AI implementation can increase radical right support, expanding their electoral base beyond the middle-skilled blue collars to highly skilled professionals.
